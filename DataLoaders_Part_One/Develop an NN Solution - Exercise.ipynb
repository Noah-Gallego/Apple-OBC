    "# Develop an NN Solution ðŸ§ \n",
    "\n",
    "Apply your PyTorch skills to the problem of optimized battery charging; training a simple NN to predict the `duration` for how long a user will plug-in and charge their device in future, based on past data. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, it is expected that you have two featurized, battery charging datasets: training data and test data. In this notebook, you should load in that data and use it to train and evaluate a simple neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network does not need to be your best solution, just a proof-of-concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To know whether or not you are on the right track, aim for a test RMSE of around 3hrs. \n",
    "\n",
    "This RMSE (the square root of a squared value) roughly means that the average error in predicting the duration of a plug-in charge event is around 3hrs. The ideal would be 0 average error, but the reality is that being within a few hours of a correct prediction can still be very helpful in deciding when to pause and resume charging, such that battery lifespan can be increased without a sacrifice to the user experience! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your tasks\n",
    "To create an NN-based solution to OBC, complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Loading Custom Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load in your train/test battery datasets\n",
    "2. Create DataLoaders for those datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2: Training and Evaluating a Simple NN**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define and train a simple NN\n",
    "4. Evaluate your NN on some test data, recording the resultant RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering: *How do I submit this in parts?* \n",
    "\n",
    "> You will be expected to submit this notebook **twice** for grading; once, when you've completed part one, and once when you've completed the entire baseline solution (part two). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: It may be helpful to reference the codebase for Household Power Prediction, which you saw a while agoâ€”this codebase contains several helper functions for training and testing a model; including converting a typical MSE function into an RMSE value. "
