    "At this point, it's assumed that you've explored the [battery charging dataset on Trove](https://trove.apple.com/dataset/aiedu_battery_charging/1.0.0) and are familiar with the variables in that data and what they represent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, it will be up to you to transform the battery charging dataset into a dataset that can be used for training an ML model, including calculating and adding new columns to the data that can be used as input features. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a step known as **feature engineering**, where input features are numerical values or categories that will help you to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format-wise your final data should satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "* You've created at least 2 input features that you think will be useful for prediction\n",
    "* Every column is an input feature or a predictive target (targets are typically the _last_ column(s) in a dataset)\n",
    "* There are no missing (nan) values in your data\n",
    "* Your data is split into two sets: training and test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your final training and test datasets should be something that can be directly used for training and evaluating a simple NN or a baseline model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for creating features\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, you will be tasked with performing the following steps and creating an _initial_ featurized dataset to use for model training: \n",
    ">1. **Loading the data**: Create an initial DataFrame to work with \n",
    "2. **Define a target**: Define a predictive target and make it one column in your data\n",
    "3. **Removing noise and null values**: Removing values that are noisy or not useful for the predictive model you want to build\n",
    "4. **Train/test split**: Splitting the data into train/test sets\n",
    "5. **Creating features**: Transforming data and creating new input features that you think will have predictive power\n",
    "6. **Saving data**: Saving your transformed training and test data so you can use it for model training!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about making the _best_ features; consider this notebook a starting point that you can revisit; later, adding new features and removing others to get the best features for your predictive goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed this notebook, you'll submit it, alongside any helper functions, for review by the Education team. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Your tasks will be marked as **TASK**s in markdown and `##TODOs` in code. \n"

    "For optimized battery charging, we want to predict how long someone is likely to plug-in and charge their device, and so the plug-in events are the most important source of data, but you can still use information about un-plugged events and battery charge levels to create input features that may be useful for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information can be _merged_ into your plug-in events DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging data: example\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to record the battery charge level at the `start` of a plug-in event, because you hypothesize that when users have a lower charge level, they are more likely to plug-in their devices for a long `duration`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> However, plug-in events and battery charge level information are contained in two different _streams_ of data: '/device/isPluggedIn' and '/device/batteryPercentage'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're interested in the `start` charge level at the start of a plug-in event, we can do what's called a data **merge** or join on that column by doing the following two steps. \n",
    "1. Create two different DataFrames; one for plug-in events and one for battery charge levels\n",
    "2. Merge the two based on their respective `start` times to create a single DataFrame with _both_ plug-in and battery charge level information. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not-matching `start` times\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides a few different functions for merging DataFrames, including `merge()` which is helpful for merging on exactly-matching values, but this is not useful in this case because the `start` of a battery charge level event and the `start` of a plug-in event may not match up to the minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we want a merge function that allows us to match on the _closest_ `start` times between the two streams, which we can do with the pandas function `merge_asof()`. \n",

    "\n",
    "> **TASK**: Create a DataFrame of _only_ the battery level stream; you should already have a DF of plug-in events from earlier tasks. Define those two DataFrames, then run the provided code to use `merge_asof()` and get a `battery_start_level` column in a new DataFrame, `plug_in_charge_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The resultant, `plug_in_charge_df` should be the DataFrame you continue to work with, as you proceed in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, the two DataFrames that you provide will be merged based on a few parameters:\n",
    "* on - column name that I want to *near-match* in the left and right df's (`start`)\n",
    "* by - column(s) that should *exactly-match* between left and right df's (`user_id`)\n",
    "* direction - whether to search for prior, next, or generally closest matches for the _on_ column values (`forward`)\n",
